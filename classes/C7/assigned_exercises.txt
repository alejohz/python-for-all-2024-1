ARDILA PEREZ,VALENTINA: Develop a Python program to transform single-digit numbers from a list into their corresponding English words, sorted in reverse order. For [0, 2, 1], the output should be ['two', 'one', 'zero'].

BUSTOS GIRALDO,PAOLA ANDREA: Develop a Python program to reverse only the words of odd length in a given sentence. For Simple exercises, the output should be elpmiM exercises.

CABALLERO PIMENTEL,SAMUEL DAVID: Create a Python program to find the longest common suffix between two strings. For the strings thinking and walking, it should return ing. For introduction and reduction, return tion.

CAÑOLA MONTOYA,SANTIAGO: Program a solution that finds the nearest palindrome number to a given integer. If two palindromes are equidistant, return the smaller one. Examples: 234 should return 232, and 99 should return 101.

CORDERO GUERRA,ALEXANDER JOSE: Develop a Python function to check if the average of numbers in an array is a whole number. For [3, 6, 9], return True; for [2, 5], return False.

ECHEVERRI MARTINEZ,JORGE DANIEL: Develop a Python function that iteratively calculates the cube root of a given positive integer until the resultant value is less than 3, and count the number of iterations needed. Example: For 27, the output should be 1, and for 500, the output should be 3.

GALLEGO TORRES,ANGELA MARCELA: Develop a Python function to evaluate how many numbers in a list are greater than the number immediately preceding them. Example: For the list [2, 5, 3, 6, 10], the result should be 3.

ISAZA VILLA,JUAN FERNANDO: Create a Python script that sorts every other element of a list while keeping the rest in their original positions. For [10, 1, 30, 2, 50], return [10, 1, 30, 2, 50]. [30, 2, 50, 1, 10] -> [10, 2, 30, 1, 50]

LEZCANO QUINTERO,VICTOR DANIEL: Develop a Python script that receives a positive integer and constructs a matrix of that dimension filled entirely with the integer itself. Example: For input 3, the output should be [[3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3], [3, 3, 3]]. For input 4, produce [[4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4], [4, 4, 4, 4]]. Input of 0 should return an empty list [].

LUCUARA NOREÑA,RAFAEL ANTONIO: Construct a Python function to generate the smallest number containing specified counts of even and odd digits. For instance, if asked for 1 even and 2 odd digits, return 113.

MUÑOZ URUEÑA,JORGE ANDRES: Develop a Python program to determine if the cube root of the first number in a two-element list is equal to the square root of the second. For [27, 9], return True; for [8, 9], return False.

OROZCO RINCON,JUAN MIGUEL: Develop a Python program to find the first occurrence of a negative cumulative balance from sequential lists of bank transactions. For [[100, -150], [200, -100, -200]], the output should be [-50, None].

VELÁSQUEZ PÉREZ,ALEJANDRO: Develop a program that sums the cubes of all positive integers smaller than a given positive integer. For 3, return 9; for 4, return 36.

CASTELBLANCO GALLEGO, JUAN PABLO: Develop a Python function to calculate the sum of all positive and negative numbers separately from an array, and display which sum is larger. For [-3, 5, -2, 7], the result should be 12 (positive sum).

GARCÍA BOTERO, SEBASTIAN: Create a Python program that checks if the sum of the digits of three given integers is the same. Return True or False accordingly. For instance, [111, 30, 60] should return True, while [17, 28, 39] should return False.
